## Week 3 Monday

    - Prettier
- Our path forward
    - HTML/CSS Intro
        - HTML is used to structure web pages.
        - CSS is used to make the web pages look good.
    - Bootstrap Intro
        - Bootstrap is a JavaScript library that adds interactivity and functionality to a website.
        - Using Bootstrap saves a developer time and effort by not having to write alot of JavaScript or CSS functionality from scratch.
        - There are pre-made Bootstrap templates that a developer can use as a starter template for their website.
        - Pre-made Bootstrap templates allow user to change the look and feel of their website quickly.
    - Find a template
        - We will find a template based on Bootstrap for our website.
    - Create Project 0 from template
        - After finding a Bootstrap template that we like, we will use that template for our Project 0.
        - For our Project 0, we will rely on the Bootstrap library and our chosen template to do the heavy lifting.
- HTML
    - The html template created by Visual Studio Code is the basic skeleton for a web page.
    - The basic skeleton for a web page includes these tags: DOCTYPE, html, head, meta, body
    - Meta tags are not required but it's good practice to have them.
    - Here is a brief summary of each tag:
        - DOCTYPE - This tells the web browser the document is an html document
        - html - This tag is used to specify the language for your web page.
        - head - Defines the head section of your web page, which is above the body.
        - meta - Meta tags always go inside the head section of the html document. Meta tags are important for Search Engine Optimization, Viewport configuration, and providing basic information for web browsers.
        - body - The body is where the content of your web page goes.

- My thoughts
    - I already knew 90% of the tags in the html template.
    - The only tags that have always seemed confusing to me are the meta tags. When I learned about them a long time ago they were a little different then the ones created by Visual Studio Code.

## Week 3 Thursday

- DOM
    - Is a tree-like structure that represents all the elements of a web page, including the HTML tags, text, images, forms and buttons. 
    - Each element in the DOM is considered a node, and they're all connected to each other in a hierarchical way.
    - The root element of the DOM is the <html> tag. This element is at the top in the hierarchy.
    - The <head> and <body> elements are the children of the <html> element
    - In the <body> tag, are all the other elements that make up the content of a web page.
      This includes paragraphs, headings, images, and links. The elements in the body are the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the <html> element.

- How much of this did you know?
    - I already knew most of this because I already took CIT93. 
    - The reason I took CIT93 before this class is I was only going to take 1 class at FCC to refresh on JavaScript.
      But then I decided I would go ahead and do the whole certificate program.
    - Even though I know most of this, it was still helpful and a good learning experience to refresh myself with the HTML elements and listening to the terms being used in a lecture.
      
## CSS

### Anatomy of a Website
A good way to think of the anatomy of a website is as follows.

    - HTML is the skeleton of a website, CSS is like the clothes or skin of a website and JavaScript is the brain of the website. 
    - CSS is a style sheet language that you use to create the look and feel of a website. 
    - CSS is analogous to the fabric, yarn and ink you use to make your clothes.

### My Understanding of CSS

    - When making clothes in real life, you just don't go to Walmart and buy fabric, first you have to look at maybe a pattern for the shirt you are making. Then you buy the color fabric you want and thread, buttons, zippers and any other bells and whistles you might want. The same goes for putting clothes on your website's skeleton. First, maybe you can go look at other websites as pattern examples. Then when you get an idea of what colors you like and bells and whistles you might want to add to your website. 

    - You can reference the [CSS Documentation Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) for reference info. 

    - By referencing the CSS documentation, you can view examples of the syntax of how to style a button or a header and the recommended properties and values to use. It's similar to if you get an air fryer for Christmas. Before you cook something in it, you need to know what settings you need to set for your garlic chicken recipe. By looking at the user manual it gives you some examples of settings to use with chicken, beef or fish. It's the same with the CSS. If you want a recipe to create a button that looks blue on page load and changes style when you hover over the button, you need to gather your research information before creating your recipe. You first look up the syntax for styling a button with CSS on the CSS documentation website, then you can look for the color codes you might want to use, then, if want to add border styles or drop shadow or other styles you research them the same way. Once your research is done, then you create your button. Then you would do a similar workflow process to style all the elements on your website. One thing to note is that using CSS to give style to a website's skeleton takes time. It takes time not because it's difficult but because using styles can lead to indecision and is time-consuming. Have you ever gone to Jcpenney or Macy's and tried on some jeans in the fitting room and then couldn't decide which ones you liked better then before you know it an hour has already passed? 

    - When working with CSS one should allot plenty of time for CSS tasks because indecision might arise and you could end up in a rabbit hole of colors and color wheels.

    - Another thing to consider when adding CSS to style your website is the importance of color selection. Different colors convey different emotions when humans see those colors. So web designers who create websites for banks that target business users and the financial industry might want to use different colors than those used in sports websites that target sports fans. There are many websites a web designer can reference. 
    
    - This one is a good example. Here you get a good idea of the emotions and moods different colors evoke.

    - Adding style to a website with CSS is fun but takes time and is not an exact art.  It's similar to real-world art. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. In the real world the stakeholders of the company you are creating the website for have the biggest say along with the Web Designer's boss. Web Designers can give their input, but at the end of the day, your design has to pass through your boss and stakeholder's approval. So it takes a lot of revisions when styling your website and getting final sign-off approval of the look and feel.
